An atmospheric, top-down survival incremental game built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

**Version:** v1.3 (Stable)  
**Platform:** Web (HTML5/JavaScript)

## Overview

VOID-KEEPER is a survival game where you must maintain a lighthouse beacon against an encroaching darkness. Your mission: keep the light burning, scavenge for resources, and survive as long as possible.

## Gameplay

- **Survive:** Your lighthouse burns Carbon fuel. If it reaches zero, you're consumed by the darkness.
- **Scavenge:** The fog hides valuable debris. Use your light beam to reveal resources hidden in the darkness.
- **Focus Mode:** Hold **Left Mouse Button** to stop rotation and narrow your beam. This increases burn power, allowing you to reach distant objects.
- **Collect:** Click on revealed debris to harvest Carbon (fuel) or Scrap (currency).
- **Upgrade:** Spend Scrap to improve your Lens, Gear (rotation speed), and Focus capabilities.
